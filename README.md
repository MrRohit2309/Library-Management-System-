📚 Library Management System (DBMS Project)

📌 Project Overview
The Library Management System is a database-driven web application designed to automate and manage core library operations such as book records, student access, and database interactions.
This project is developed as part of a DBMS academic project to demonstrate practical implementation of database concepts integrated with a web-based interface.

🎯 Objectives
1. To design and implement a structured library database
2. To manage book and student records efficiently
3. To reduce manual effort in library operations
4. To demonstrate DBMS concepts such as tables, queries, and relationships
5. To integrate backend logic with a frontend interface

🛠️ Technologies Used
> Frontend: HTML
> Backend: Node.js, JavaScript
> Database: SQL (MySQL / compatible RDBMS)
> Tools: Git, GitHub, npm

🗄️ Database Design
The database is designed using relational principles and includes:
1. Tables for books
2. Tables for students
3. SQL queries for inserting, updating, and retrieving data
4. Database schema is provided in: db.sql
