# Library Management System DBMS Project

##📌 Project Description
The Library Management System is a database-driven web application designed to automate and manage essential library operations such as book records, student access, and database interactions.

This project is developed as part of an academic DBMS course to demonstrate the practical application of database management concepts integrated with a web-based interface.

🎯 Objectives
🗂️ Design and implement a structured relational database

👨‍🎓 Manage student and book records efficiently

⏱️ Reduce manual workload in library operations

🧠 Apply DBMS concepts like tables, queries, and relationships

🔗 Integrate backend logic with a frontend interface

---

 ## ✨ Features
🔐 Student login system

📘 Book record management

🌐 Backend server for handling requests

🗃️ Structured SQL database

🧩 Clean separation of frontend and backend

📁 Well-organized GitHub repository

🗄️ Database Design
📘 Books table

🎓 Students table

🔑 Primary keys and relationships

🔍 SQL queries for insert, update, and retrieval
