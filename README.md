# 📚 Library Management System – DBMS Project

---

## 📌 Project Description
The **Library Management System** is a **database-driven web application** designed to automate and manage essential library operations such as **book records**, **student access**, and **database interactions**.

This project is developed as part of an academic **Database Management Systems (DBMS)** course to demonstrate the **practical implementation of database management concepts** integrated with a **web-based interface**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- 🗂️ Design and implement a structured relational database  
- 👨‍🎓 Manage student and book records efficiently  
- ⏱️ Reduce manual workload in library operations  
- 🧠 Apply DBMS concepts such as tables, queries, and relationships  
- 🔗 Integrate backend logic with a frontend interface  

---

## ✨ Features
- 🔐 Student login system  
- 📘 Book record management  
- 🌐 Backend server handling client requests  
- 🗃️ Structured SQL database  
- 🧩 Clean separation of frontend and backend  
- 📁 Well-organized GitHub repository  

---

## 🗄️ Database Design
- 📘 Books table  
- 🎓 Students table  
- 🔑 Primary keys and relationships  
- 🔍 SQL queries for insert, update, and retrieval operations  
- 🧾 Database schema available in `db.sql`  

---

## 🛠️ Technology Used
- 🎨 **Frontend:** HTML  
- ⚙️ **Backend:** Node.js, JavaScript  
- 🗄️ **Database:** MySQL (SQL / RDBMS)  
- 🧰 **Tools:** Git, GitHub, npm  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. 👤 User accesses the frontend interface  
2. 🔐 Student logs in using the login page  
3. 📡 Frontend sends requests to the backend server  
4. 🗄️ Backend interacts with the MySQL database  
5. ✅ Requested data is retrieved and displayed to the user

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### 🔹 Backend Setup
```bash
cd Library-Management-System-
npm install
node server.js
```
---

## 🌐 Frontend Setup
Open the project folder

Open Library Frontend.html in a web browser

Use the interface to manage library operations
